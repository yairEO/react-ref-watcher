      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

  <!-- <p>
    This POC intends to solve the problem where refs are used on the "main" component, to store
    different state values, because if <code>"useState"</code> were used, when changed, the main component (<code>List</code>)
    will re-render, along with all its sub-components ðŸ˜¢
  </p>
  <p>
    A <code>context</code> is used to pass all sub-components those refs, so each sub-component can chose to register a listener
    to a specific ref or, if the ref's <code>"current"</code> property is an Object, listen to changes in that Object.
  </p>
  <p>
    When toggling a list item (checkbox), only it will render, and not any of its siblings.
  </p>
